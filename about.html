            Howdy! We are a team of collegiate engineers from Texas A&M university. We met in our dorm at the beginning of the year and have teamed up ever since. We are very different people; however, we all share a common bond when it comes to coding. When we heard about the hackathon we thought it would be a really exciting but challenging activity to participate in. We signed up, not really knowing what to expect. Although it has been very difficult and tiring, this experience has truly been one that we will remember for the rest of our lives. Win or lose, we put our heart and sole into this project and that's all we could do. We hope you enjoy our website!
